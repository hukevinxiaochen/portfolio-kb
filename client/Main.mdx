I am a board-certified family physician (ABFM) who occasionally builds web
applications, frequently works in a federally qualified health center, and is
usually saying things like:

- Tell me more...
- What do the guidelines say? Do I agree?
- What has been observed? Not observed?
- Can we make a computer do that?
- Everyone deserves a fair shake at living long, healthy, and relatively
  trauma-free lives right?
