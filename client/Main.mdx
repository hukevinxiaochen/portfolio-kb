I am a board-certified family physician (ABFM) who occasionally builds web
applications, frequently works in a federally qualified health center, and is
usually saying things like:

- Tell me more...
- What do the guidelines say? Do I agree?
- What has been observed? Not observed?
- Can we make a computer do that?
- Everyone deserves a fair shake at living long, healthy, and relatively
  trauma-free lives right?

    <summary>Want to collaborate?</summary>If you're here, you already know how
    to reach me via email, phone, or any of my social media links. I keep my
    calendar pretty accurately up-to-date so don't be a stranger.
